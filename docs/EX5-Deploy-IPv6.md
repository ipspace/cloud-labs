# Deploy IPv6 in Your Cloud Virtual Network

This exercise seems easy but might require extensive research:

* Enable dual stack (IPv4 + IPv6) throughout the virtual networking infrastructure you created in the [previous exercise](EX4-Deploy-Virtual-Network.md).
* Enable IPv6 on your virtual machines
* Test HTTPS/SSH connectivity over IPv6

!!! Tip
    You can skip this exercise and focus on more exciting topics if you feel IPv6 is (not yet) relevant to your environment.
