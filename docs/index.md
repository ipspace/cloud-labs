# Networking in Public Cloud Deployments

Networking engineers attending the [Networking in Public Cloud Deployments](https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/) online course had to solve several hands-on assignments, including:

* [Define the Requirements](EX1-Define-Requirements.md)
* [Simple Infrastructure-as-Code Setup](EX2-Infrastructure-as-Code.md)
* [Deploy a Cloud-Based Web Server ](EX3-Deploy-Web-Server.md)
* [Deploy a Virtual Network Infrastructure](EX4-Deploy-Virtual-Network.md)
* [Deploy IPv6 in Your Cloud Virtual Network](EX5-Deploy-IPv6.md)
* [Secure Your Virtual Network Infrastructure](EX6-Security.md)

I reviewed every single solution submitted by the course attendees. I can't do the same for everyone else, but you might still want to try to solve at least some of the challenges.
